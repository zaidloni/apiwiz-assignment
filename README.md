Requirement 1:
Real-time Text Analyzer Build a text analyzer that calculates the following metrics in real-time as the user types a paragraph:

1. Number of Characters
2. Number of Words
3. Number of Sentences
4. Number of Paragraphs
5. Number of Spaces
6. Number of Punctuations

Please ensure that the calculations are dynamic and update in real-time as the user modifies the input text.

Requirement 2:
Show Word Details.
We have attached a link to the api which will give definitions to any word
The API response will contain an array of objects, each representing properties like definition, parts of speech, synonyms, types, and examples of the entered word. Consider only the first object from the array.

Use the values obtained from the API response to create a user interface (UI) that matches the Figma design provided to you. The UI should display the relevant information in a clear and visually appealing manner.
